# CPUinfi - Simple System Monitor.

CPUInfi, my first ever published Project. Built around the C++ Language, inspired by CPUID 

## What can i do on CPUinfi?

You can simply look at your computer information. lol

## Will CPUinfi be getting a V1?

Yes. CPUinfi is gonna get a V1 when i can. as of day one i am gonna work on it until i feel like V1 can come out.

The whole reason i made CPUinfi is to see how C++ works. This took me 1 week to build (with help with Copilot)

## Was AI used to make it?

Not Really. i used Visual Studios 2026's Copilot Plugin to help me clean up and errors and bugs i could find. I wrote 98% of the code on this.


# Thank you for using CPUinfi. idk what else to put here lol
